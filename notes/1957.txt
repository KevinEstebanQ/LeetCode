# Intuition
tho my first intuition was to use a sliding window technique to check for the repaeting characters 
a simple count and update previous approach was easier to implement

# Approach
a new string is intialize at the value of the first character of the non fancy string,
then whe loop throught the whole lenght of the string, checking the amount of times a single character is repeated
if the char at i is the same as our previous character then we update the flag to +1
if they are not the same we update previous, reset flag and keep going, we only update our Fancy string if
at the time of the current iteration we have a flag that is less than 3, only then we append our answer to the fancy string


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
whe only loop once so O(n) with n being the length of the String


- Space complexity:
we are creating a new string and it can end up being the same length of the original string if it already is a valid fancy string
so worst case the new string will equal original lenght, worst case O(n) space

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def makeFancyString(self, s: str) -> str:
        flag = 1
        prev = s[0]
        newString=""
        newString+=prev
        for i in range(1, len(s)): #aaba, last index 3
            if s[i] == prev:
                flag +=1
            else:
                prev = s[i]
                flag = 1
            if flag < 3:
                newString+=s[i]
        return newString
