# Intuition
the problem wasnt too hard to understand, the only difficult part is having an optimized way of findfing the GCD
and working correctly with the Linked ListNode


# Approach
we create a function to get the GCD using euclids algorithm, then traverse the linked list updating the 
references to add the GCD between the 2 original nodes

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) as we move through n pairs of nodes and the euclids algorith is O(Log v)
so the algorith is O(n * Log V)

- Space complexity:
auxiliary space is O(1) and the list nodes is O(n)

# Code
```python3 []
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    
    def insertGreatestCommonDivisors(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        def getGCD(a:int, b:int)->int:
            while b:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        curr = head
        nextNode = curr.next

        while curr.next != None:
            GCD = getGCD(curr.val, nextNode.val)
            newNode = ListNode(val=GCD)

            curr.next = newNode
            newNode.next = nextNode
            curr = nextNode
            nextNode = curr.next

        return head

        

        
```
