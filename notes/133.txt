# Intuition
at first I was confused by the wording but understood that somehow a map had to be used to keep track of the nodes
being created

# Approach
create a map that saves the clones as values for the keys(original references)
then do a dfs appending the neighbors which calls the dfs for every element in the list of conections
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) as we go through the graph once

- Space complexity:
O(n) as we create a new graph and save values in a map

# Code
```python3 []
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
"""

class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:

        def dfs(node1):
            if node1 in oldToNew:
                return oldToNew[node1]
            if not node1:
                return
            copy = Node(node1.val)
            oldToNew[node1] = copy
            for n in node1.neighbors:
                copy.neighbors.append(dfs(n))

            return copy

        return dfs(node)
