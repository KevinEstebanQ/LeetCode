# Intuition
my first intuition was to take the total frequency and sort by that but it wouldnt take into account the amount of times the number appears
second approach came by finding the idea alsewhere that i can use the frequency to append the number frequency times

# Approach
create a counter obj and sort it by frequency first then by its number negated to account for decreasing order if frequencies are the same
the use the tupple created by sorting and use its indicies by element to append number Frequency times in the order described above

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(NlogN) as we sort

- Space complexity:
O(n) as we have to save n elementes, not inplace

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        count = sorted(Counter(nums).items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
        ans = []

        for tup in count:
            for i in range(tup[1]):
                ans.append(tup[0])
        return ans

```
