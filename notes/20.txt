# Intuition
i hadnt thought about using a stack for keeping track of the parenthesis but it does sound obvious once i
began looking for clues at first i was going to use string scanning with no keeping track which is not efficient

# Approach
create a stack and if the current char is an opening bracket the push onto the stack, if its a closing
then check the output of the pop, if its not a closing and matching parentheses then we return false

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) as we look through the whole length of the string in the worst case

- Space complexity:
we might get all characters as opening so worst case O(n) saved chars in the stach

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        if len(s) <=1:
            return False

        for b in s: 
            if b in "({[":
                stack.append(b)
            else:
                if len(stack) == 0:
                    return False

                opp = stack.pop()
                match opp:
                    case '(':
                        if b != ')':
                            return False
                    case '[':
                        if b != ']':
                            return False
                    case '{':
                        if b != '}':
                            return False
        return not stack
