# Intuition
My first intuition for this problem was to convert the nums easily to a string and use
2 pointers to check if their ends were equal, at the moment where they were not then we can safely return
false

# Approach
create a single for loop and a variable that uses the index created by the range to check the number from the right
and keep going down, check their equality and return the resul

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
we are checking the whole string to O(n)

- Space complexity:
we are checking in place, no copying to O(1)

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        stringNum = str(x)
        n = len(stringNum)
        for i in range(n-1):
            j=n-i-1
            if stringNum[i] != stringNum[j]:
                return False
        return True

```
