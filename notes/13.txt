# Intuition
my first intuition was to save the numerals in a map for quick and easy access, then loop through
the characters in the string, the do various checs with 2 pointers, if at any momnent we find a numeral
at i that is smaller in value than j (i=1) then instead of adding the values we substract


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) for the time, n is the input string

- Space complexity:
the map doesnt grow, its constant, O(1)

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        
##ej IV = 4, bc I < V then ans = I - V = 4
# i ii iii iv v vi vii viii ix xx xxi xxii xxiii xxiiv the only real check we have to make is if our current numeral is
# a 1, ie I, if the next digit is greater than it the the sum is s[i+1]-s[i]
        numerals = {"I":1,"V":5,"X":10,"L":50,"C":100,"D":500,"M":1000}
        sum=0
        i = 0
        while i < len(s): 
            if i+1 < len(s):
                if numerals[s[i]] < numerals[s[i + 1]]: 
                    sum+= numerals[s[i+1]] - numerals[s[i]]
                    i = i  + 2 
                else:
                    sum+=numerals[s[i]] 
                    i= i + 1 
            else:
                sum+=numerals[s[i]] 
                i = i + 1
        return sum
