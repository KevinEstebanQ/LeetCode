## LeetCode Practice
This is the Readme file for my Personal LeetCode Notebook

### Purpose--
to save up my reasoning for every leetcode problem I come accross, to have reference material for the future, keep on practicing problem solving
and save useful solutions I may come across in either discussions, internet in general, or my own solutions (preferably)

### Structure--
every file will most surely be a python file with the solution, but I may also upload Java, Javascript, C, or C++ solutions in the future
a Dir named Notes will have my individual notes for every leetcode problem I try to solve, they will not have an specific order.

## Notes---
they will be structured as such. Leetcode problem Number followed by its name, a quick summary of what the problem is asking for and my reasoning for the solution, if a faster solution exists then it will be added in the end of the file.
